# Process for Landing Changes

Per the group's [2015-Jan-27 agreement] (http://www.w3.org/2015/01/27-touchevents-minutes.html#item05), the following process is used to review and approve Pull Requests:

* Submit a pull request and post the PR's link to the [public-touchevents] (https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-touchevents/) e-mail list asking for feedback.
* As soon as one of the listed spec editors approves the PR it can be merged.
* If there's debate over a PR that has already landed, it may be reverted until consensus is reached.
